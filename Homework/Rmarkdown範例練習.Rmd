## Notes on the YAML header

- Be sure to change the title and author fields
- The date is automatically set to the current day when knitting
- The `header-includes` portion loads a personal sheet of LaTeX macros. I recommend making one of these as well as it can greatly speed up the time to input math. See my personal macro file `hayesmacros.sty` as a starting point. If you aren't going to load a \LaTeX macro file, remove those lines.
    - `hayesmacros.sty` needs to be in the same folder as this file

# Problem 1

Here is a [link](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). Your homework goes here.

Briefly, some of the custom latex macros: $y = \b x + \e$. Also, some code:

```{r}
fit <- lm(hp ~ ., mtcars)
au <- broom::augment(fit)

au %>% 
  gather(x, val, -contains(".")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(val, .resid)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~x, scales = "free")
```

Yet more text, and another code section:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(select(au, 1:5)))
```

# Code

```{r ref.label = knitr::all_labels(), echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# this R markdown chunk generates a code appendix
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
